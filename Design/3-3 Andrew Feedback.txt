ANDREW NOTES

JTAG
	have 20p
	go to 10
		rst
		swd
		clk
		P
		G
	
Only need JTAG for prototyping

MicroSD needs power switch
	p channel mosfet
	turn off for power savings when not in use
	
no pullups on STIO
	use i/f
	
Boot modes
	not needed
	boot 0 as pb
	
c14 not needed
	
16 MHz from 25Mhz
	16 for USB
	
resistor on LED

schottky diodes instead of switch for power source

Batteries
	3 = 4.5v
	LDO voltage regulator
	
I2C needs pullups

circuit breaker chip | USB current limiter
	100 mA
	shorted indicator
	
ESD protection
	ADC lines && I2C
	anything that goes to outside world
	TVS transient voltage suppressor

pull high circuitry on usb lines

USB ID pin floats

TAPs for anything we dont understand

resistors on GPIOs

RBG LED for status feedback

4-5 LEDs for whatever

GCC open source compiler

Every Vdd needs to be power controlled with mosfet or something

replace all Vdds with 3.3

Use smt crystal

all components on top

4 layer board

as little through hole components as possible

through hole on all outside connections
	microusb connector 
	Molex
	
All components expected to use 3.3v - no 5v

boards
	sparkfun
		accel
		light
		color
		
Bosch VOC

RTC Sync
	V batt line
		supercap | button cell
		
SD Card
	NO 1.8 operation
	card detect switch to GPIO
	
SDIO gotchas
	super careful not to corrupt filesystem
	Use btn to GPIO to request eject

SOFT/FIRMWARE:
NO DFU
COM port
	open source code
	config to flash
	
dont do mass storage
	can implement in the future
dont do HID

DO
	**serial port**
	
	
Dont do sdout feedback over JTAG

for power savings, sample for a long time and write out in bulk
	at least > 512bytes
		
I2C DAUGHTERBOARD
	remove level shifter
