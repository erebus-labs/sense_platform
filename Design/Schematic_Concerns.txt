SD Memory Card 
    - Based on the schematic on page 57 of UM1057, SW1 pin is connected to PH13 (MicroSDCard_Detect), 
    But LQFP64 doesn't have this pin, so should it be floating?
    - No pin exist on the stm32f2 chip to reset the SD card, but one alternative would be using a PMOS transistor to remove the power from SD card 
    

I2C1 pins: PB6 and PB7
    Currently the above pins are connected to a 4 pin male header (sensor header), would that be correct?
 
ADC pin: ADC1_IN1---> is connected to a 3 pin male header (sensor header), would that be correct?

RTC : 
    Not sure about what exact functionality is expected from RTC and its RTC_ALARM output. In stmCube, I chose: RTC --> Alarm A ---> Internal Alarm ---> Timestamp routed to AF1
    From hardware point of view, should I put an LED on the RTC_AF1 pin, to indicate the alarm? 
    (I would appreciate some explanation about the expected behavior of RTC_Alarm in our design)


Timer:
    The IC has multiple timers and I'm not sure about what exact functionality is expected from timer.
    (I would appreciate some explanation about the expected behavior of timer in our design)

USB Block:
    Based on what I studied, Pin 4 (ID pin of micro USB) of USB connector should be floating for USB On-The-Go B-Device; do you think this is correct? 
    ERC gives error that this pin is not connected.
