				Inexpensive
				Open source
				Accessible (K-12)
			Wanted for STEM purposes
		background info
			Erebus
				Frackensense

	Project Statement
		Goals and Deliverables
	Methodology
		Hardware
			Main Board
				STM
				SD card
				USB port
				Power regulation
				JTAG
				SD eject request button
				Indicator LEDs
					Low power
					Sensor read error
					Low storage
					Reading out-of-range
					Safe to eject SD
				Headers
					Power / GND
					TAPs
					Sensors
						ADC
						TWI
			Sensor
				TWI
					May be stacked/chained
					Set sensor address with dip switches
				ADC
					One per channel
				Sensing component
		Firmware
			
		Software (Chrome extension)
			Describe configuration
				Which sensors
				Addresses / ports
			Describe system parameters
				Low storage threshold
				Record until full vs. Overwrite oldest data
				Conditional data logging parameters, e.g.
					time window
					repeating schedule
					conditional on sensor values
					conditional on battery level
			Describe parameters (per sensor)
				Polling frequency
				Interrupt condition (to take a measurement)
				Out-of-range threshold(s)
			Program the Hardware
				Run a self check
					Indicate any errors
		Support
			Manuals, Wikis, Readmes
	Resource requirements
		None, besides component reimbursement and professional input.
	Schedule

	Cannabalize UI FRD for proposal
	Make Diagrams
		Main Board
		Sensor Board
			ADC / I2C example
		UI
		Storyboard
			Determine how to set up their experiment
			describe that setup to the software
			Connect the hardware the hardware the same way
				Connect sensors
				setting address switches
			program the hardware
			set up the hardware in place with a power supply
			retrieve data log from SD card
